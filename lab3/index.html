        <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>The idea of this lab is to further create a local file strucutre on my computer an add index.html files.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I was able to re-create the file stritures correctly once I followed the instructions all the way around carefully. I had also to pay close attention to my code and figure out what went wrong.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> Well your are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
        <img src = "img/FileStructure.png" width=650><p></p>
        <p> Here are the images of the HTML codes for the index files:</p>
        <img src = "img/HomePage Index HTML.png" width=650><p></p>
        <img src = "img/Lab3 Index HTML.png" width=650><p></p>
