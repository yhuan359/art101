        <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>The idea of this lab is to further create a local file strucutre on my computer an add index.html files.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I was easily able to create the file stritures once I got the hang of it, but I had to pay close attention to my code and figure out what went wrong </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> This is my first html fire that I made for this class.</p>
