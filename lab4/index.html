			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It was easy to create a list in high level task, but much more works to turn it into the codes.</p>
					<p>As of now, I do not start the coding yet, but this pesudo codes will help me to do so later.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I found the initial high-level task was not working out the way I thought when turn them into details. I had to re-org them to make sense for the future codeing.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It's a great practice. The prsudo code provides me the clear picture how to proceed for the coding later on, without running to the wrong path. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<h2>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
					<pre><code>
						Changing the laptop battery:
							1.	Look for the right battery model and order it
							2.	Unscrew the cover on the bottom of the laptop
							3.	Remove bolts around the battery
							4.	Take the original battery out
							5.	Put in the new battery
							6.	Screw the bolts back in to secure the battery
							7.	Put back the cover on the back for the laptop
							8.	Turn on the laptop and charge the battery to validate if the new battery works.
						</code></pre>

					<h2>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game</h2>
					<pre><code>
							Creating a Blackjack card game:
							1.	Set the rule of game winning, eg. Points of the cards more than 17.
							2.	Display two cards to the user.
							3.	Ask the user if she/he wants another card.
							4.	If the user doesnâ€™t want, stop.
							5.	If the user want additional card, display one more and ask again.
							6.	When the user stops taking more card, calculate the total points from the cards.
							7.	Determine if the user loss or win.
